\section*{}
This thesis originated in cooperation with the Airbus Defence and Space, Airborne Radar Processing and Safety Critical Software. \\

First of all I would like to thank Mr. J{\"u}rgen Wittig for giving me the opportunity to carry out state of the art research in this field. Special thanks to Mr. Hans-Peter Keller, Mr. Joachim Enzinger and Mr. Benjamin Baumgaertner for their guidance. \\

I thank my parents Mr. Shanmugam Maarappan and Mrs. Boopathy Shanmugam for supporting me in all the ways to pursue master studies. I also would like to thank my relatives for their support at the needful time. The journey of graduate program would not have been enjoyable without friends. I thank each and every one of them for their assistance and making my abroad stay pleasurable.
